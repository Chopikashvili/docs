The **`LEAD()`** window function takes a column and a positive integer offset as arguments and returns the value of the cell in that column that is the specified number of rows after the current row. A third argument can be added to fill cells that don't have a corresponding row.

## Syntax

```pseudo
SELECT LEAD(column1_name, offset) OVER(
  ORDER BY column2_name
)
FROM table;
```

The `ORDER BY` clause is required. You can also add a third, optional argument that sets the value of cells where the target row doesn't exist.

```pseudo
SELECT LEAD(column1_name, offset, default) OVER(
  ORDER BY column2_name
)
FROM table;
```

The third argument will be `NULL` by default.

## Example
